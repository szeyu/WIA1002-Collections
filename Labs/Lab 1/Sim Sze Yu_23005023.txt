My name is Sim Sze Yu with matrix number, 23005023. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the mooment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I an finally learn the most important concept in programming. 

I acquired A for my previous Fundamental of Programming course. It's not too bad. So I think I can manage to get at least A- for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will do a lot of leetcode exercise. Wish me luck!!!

I think have performed quite well in the class. Due to that, I feel happy with my performance. In DS, I have learnt how to think differently like a senior programmer. I target to score at least A in DS. I can understand the concept of DS. I can practise my leetcode if I have done my stuff in the tuto session. Anything I don't know I will ask my Demonstrator in the class.
